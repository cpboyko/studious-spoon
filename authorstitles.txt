Oh, she says, unhappiness! Half the misery of this world is caused not by men and women being unwilling to stay in their rooms, as Pascal thought, but by the crazy modern belief that we are all entitled to happiness in our lives. That is the curse of our time, she says, dreamed up in the eighteenth century and exported to the world in the twentieth by the USA. Who before Rousseau ever thought we were put on earth to be happy? And, ironically, as a result people were much happier then than they are now. Because they are all desperately searching for happiness, believing it’s just round the corner, embodied in a new job, a new lover, perhaps even a new car or a new pair of shoes. And then they find that it isn’t, and when the job and the lover and the car and the shoes leave them feeling just as they were before they don’t know where to turn, they eat out their hearts and their liver in bitterness till another new job, new lover, new car or new whatever swims into their ken.
